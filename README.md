# fundamentals
Sandbox for practicing computer science fundamentals around data structures and algorithms

## Run specs
`bundle exec guard`

## What's in here?

### Binary Tree

Why?
1. Practice recursion
2. A binary tree is 100x faster than finding something in an array

Use cases:
1. Create a tree using an array
2. Convert a tree back to an array
3. Check to see if a value is present in a tree
4. Get the number of nodes (size) in a tree

TODO:
- [ ] Remove all of the duplicated calls to check if left and right are nil

### Boggle

Word game to find all of the valid words in a matrix of random characters

Why?
1. Practice recursion
2. Illustrates impacts of an exponential big O

TODO:
- [ ] Make it much faster
- [ ] Write specs
